Being involved in student politics and being an active member in the Kinesiology and Physical Education Undergraduates’ Association, I have observed a couple of issues. Since Professional Faculties have their own policies and structure, it is not difficult for these faculties to be a bit detached from the services that UTSU provides. Therefore, I’d like to increase awareness of the UTSU and its services to ensure sufficient support and accessible services are provided to students in Professional Faculties. I am a student passionate about student rights in Professional Faculties -- vote Tiffany and COMPASS so we can work together to provide a wonderful year for you!",Done,tiffany-tszwing-tiu

Hey SKULE, I'm Joanna Zhou and I am running as an Engineering Director to speak up for us engineers. As a class representative in Engsci Club and active executive in IEEE, ACE, and UTCA, I am so lucky to have heard so many different voices and worked towards impactful solutions. From workshops to hackathons, Skule clubs deserve more funding to do more for students. From transit to healthcare, engineers deserve to know clearly what they've spent their money on and what they can do with the UTSU fees. Being a 2nd year Engsci myself, I've experienced times when I am simply too busy to catch up with all the details like UTSU fees refunding, dental service, and various surveys related to ourselves ---- I aim to make these things easier for you, my fellow engineers, to access and utilize your rights.","Vote COMPASS!
