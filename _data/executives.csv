I'm Joshua Grondin and I want to be YOUR next VPUA. In my time at U of T, I've seen the gaps in things like academic policy and mental health resources that keep students from succeeding - but it doesn't have to be this way. If elected, I want to ensure that struggling students have supports they need, can take risks with courses without facing harsh penalties, and can grow within and beyond campus. "

I'm Yolanda Alfaro and I'm running to be your next VPSL. It's very obvious that clubs and student societies build the foundation of student life on campus. Rather than trying to contest and duplicate the work of students, the UTSU should work to support them. If elected, I'd like to do more to support clubs and other student groups by restructuring the club funding level system that currently exists, creating more opportunities for club mentorship and training, and more. I would also like to work with these student groups and student societies to revamp orientation."

I'm Yasmine El Sanyoura and I want to be YOUR next VP Pro-Fac! As professional faculty students, we all face unique challenges and I want to make sure that YOUR experiences at UofT and UTSU don’t leave you falling through the cracks of the system. As profac students, our academic sessions often deviate from the traditional academic year, our learning experiences aren’t confined to lecture halls, and our career opportunities can seem limiting and be a source of anxiety. If elected, I want to focus on the gaps in the profac system by lobbying for better specialized embedded mental health services, addressing gaps in student rights and reforming them, and ensuring ALL ProFac students can access the facilities and services other students can, regardless of placements, PEY, and more.
