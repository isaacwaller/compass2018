A year ago, I ran as an independent candidate in the most contested UTSU election ever held. I was tired of seeing a students’ union that didn’t seem to do anything for students, and tired of seeing the same problems year after year. It was terrifying and intimidating because the UTSU felt untouchable, but I ran because I cared.

I could spend this time listing my accomplishments over the past year, but instead I’ll say this: the UTSU felt inaccessible because it was — and it still is. Students feel uneasy even walking into the UTSU office, and that sucks. Your students’ union shouldn’t feel like that.

I want a UTSU that will work tirelessly for and with you. I want a UTSU that feels human, accessible, and trustworthy. It’s time for a new direction for the UTSU. Compass is a team that believes we don’t have to choose between a UTSU that's human and a UTSU that gets results. 

If elected President, I’ll lead the UTSU into this new direction. I’ll ensure a smooth transition into the Student Commons. I’ll push for increased subsidies for student transit and the reintroduction of the Federal Transit Tax Credit for students. I’ll support a vote to leave the Canadian Federation of Students.

I came in as an outsider, but I don't intend to be the last. We're throwing the doors wide open for all the outsiders yet to come.","Vote COMPASS!

My time at U of T have been full of ups and downs. From work-study jobs, to navigating health and wellness, to being involved in different campus groups, many of the interactions I’ve went through this university as an average student.

My students’ union has never been a place I’ve felt comfortable voicing these ideas, and I’m running because I want to change that. The UTSU needs to be a place for the everyday student to feel welcomed and represented; it needs to have experience with the issues that students actually face on our campus.
