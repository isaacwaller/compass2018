A year ago, I ran as an independent candidate in the most contested UTSU election ever held. I was tired of seeing a students’ union that didn’t seem to do anything for students, and tired of seeing the same problems year after year. It was terrifying and intimidating because the UTSU felt untouchable, but I ran because I cared.  I could spend this time listing my accomplishments over the past year, but instead I’ll say this: the UTSU felt inaccessible because it was — and it still is. Students feel uneasy even walking into the UTSU office, and that sucks. Your students union shouldn’t feel like that.  I want a UTSU that will work tirelessly for and with you. I want a UTSU that feels human, accessible, and trustworthy. It’s time for a new direction for the UTSU. Compass is a team that believes we don’t have to choose between a UTSU that's human and a UTSU that gets results.   If elected President, I’ll lead the UTSU into this new direction. I’ll ensure a smooth transition into the Student Commons. I’ll push to re-introduce the Federal Transit Tax Credit and increase subsidies for student transit. I’ll support a vote to leave the Canadian Federation of Students.   One line ending","Vote COMPASS!   A year ago, I ran as an independent candidate in the most contested UTSU election ever held.
